# AGENTS

Timeless architectural principles, system boundaries, and high-level invariants for this repository.

## 1. Language and Localization

- **Code and Technical Specs in English:** English is the standard for source code, comments,
  docstrings, log messages, internal error strings, CLI diagnostics, model-facing scaffolding,
  tests, and ADRs.
- **Multi-Language Surfaces:** User-facing documentation (`README`, guides, tutorials), runtime
  localization catalogs (`monoagens/lang/<code>.yaml`), and `soul.yaml` persona content may be
  authored in multiple languages.
- **No Hardcoded Chat Strings:** All user-facing chat replies and notices must resolve through the
  localization catalog (`t()` in `monoagens/engine/i18n.py`) rather than hardcoding chat text in
  Python code.

## 2. Purpose and Hexagonal Boundaries

- **Autonomous Agent Harness:** The engine is a pure Python (`asyncio`) harness maintaining one
  continuous identity (soul), persistent hybrid memory, tool orchestration, and role-based access
  control.
- **Sacred Core (`monoagens/engine/`):** Core must remain transport-agnostic and UI-agnostic. It
  must never import gateway packages, transport SDKs, or construct platform-specific UI widgets.
- **Appendage Seam (`monoagens/engine/inbound.py`):** Gateways (`monoagens/gateways/`) connect to
  the core exclusively via transport-neutral contracts (`Percept`, `Address`, `Action`, `Receipt`,
  `GatewayCore`, and optional capability protocols). Gateways own address normalization, platform
  rendering, and interactive prompt presentation.
- **Provider Seam (`monoagens/providers/`):** LLM and speech provider adapters handle wire protocols
  and streaming deltas. Core logic never branches on provider names; capabilities are declared via
  provider defaults and configuration.
- **Async Event Loop Integrity:** Async execution paths (`async def`) must never block on
  synchronous database queries, CPU-bound embeddings/NLP, or blocking I/O. Offload synchronous work
  through the bounded executor (`await io.run(...)`).
- **Operator-Controlled Models and Limits:** Model selection, fallbacks, and numeric budgets come
  from operator configuration (`config.yaml`), never hardcoded model IDs.

## 3. Sovereign Storage and Process Invariants

- **Dedicated Sovereign Topology:**
  `1 Deployment = 1 Soul = 1 PostgreSQL Database = 1 Primary Process`.
- **Single Primary Process (Lease Fencing):** A single primary process holds the database lease
  (`engine_lease`). Mutating stores verify the lease fence; instances without the lease remain in
  standby and perform zero database writes to canonical stores. The one recorded exception is
  inbound intake: the message archive, attachment handles, and the derived document cache may
  still record what arrives while standby, so nothing is lost (`INTENTIONAL_UNFENCED` in
  `tests/test_invariant_fencing.py` lists them; adding to it needs an ADR).
- **Single System of Record:** PostgreSQL (with `pgvector` and `pg_trgm`) is the sole canonical
  data store. All schema changes go through the linear Alembic migration chain in `migrations/`.
- **Authoritative Host Configuration:** Operator files on disk (`config.yaml`, `roles.yaml`,
  `soul.yaml`, `.env`) are the source of truth; database document rows act only as derived caches.
  Secrets live exclusively in `.env`.

## 4. Memory, Privacy, and Isolation

- **Unified Hybrid Memory:** The `memories` table in PostgreSQL serves as both the canonical store
  and the hybrid retrieval index (semantic vector similarity + full-text search + salience).
- **Single Write and Read Ports:** All canonical memory writes pass through `MemoryStore`; prompt
  retrieval reads exclusively through the `memories_readable` view.
- **Layered Privacy (`L0–L4`) and Secret Rejection (`L5`):** Privacy evidence is evaluated
  deterministically before storage. Secret credentials (`L5`) are rejected. The subject of a
  personal memory retains veto power, and disclosing sensitive (`L4`) memories in shared contexts
  requires subject consent.
- **Strict Scope and Cross-Room Isolation:**
  - Automatic prompt memory retrieval is scoped strictly to `global` + `person:<sender>` +
    `thread:<active_thread>`.
  - Cross-thread history reads require proven room membership (fail-closed) and are guarded against
    verbatim cross-room leakage.

## 5. Security, Authorization, and Execution

- **Single Outbound Door:** Every outbound message, file, or side-effecting transport action must
  pass through `Agent.dispatch()` with an explicit `origin: Address` (never defaulting `origin` to
  the target address).
- **Fail-Closed RBAC:** Permissions are governed strictly by `roles.yaml`. Unknown actors or
  undeclared permissions are denied by default. `administrator` is the protected top role.
- **Safety Policy, Sandbox, and Approvals:** Sensitive tool calls (shell/container execution,
  settings mutations, destructive writes, and cross-room actions) are gated by `SafetyPolicy`,
  rootless container isolation, and explicit user approval (`/approve`).
- **Idempotent Outbound Actions:** Tool-emitted actions carry deterministic IDs recorded in the
  outbox ledger so resumed turns never duplicate external side effects.

## 6. High-Level Architecture Overview

1. **Ingress:** Gateways normalize platform events into `Percept` objects and pass them to
   `Agent.handle()`.
2. **Access & Coordination:** The access layer resolves caller identity and role permissions;
   commands execute directly while conversational messages enter the per-thread turn coordinator.
3. **Context & Memory Assembly:** The turn runner builds the stable/volatile system prompt (`soul`,
   skills, style, workspace) and retrieves scoped hybrid memories.
4. **Model & Tool Loop:** The LLM client streams responses and tool calls through the single tool
   execution door (schema validation $\to$ RBAC $\to$ safety/sandbox check $\to$ approval gate $\to$
   execution).
5. **Review & Outbound Delivery:** Draft replies pass through character polish, privacy consent
   review, and cross-room leak checks before chunked, outbox-checkpointed dispatch through
   `Agent.dispatch()` back to the target gateway.

## 7. Code Exploration, Sync Discipline, and Verification

- **Mandatory Tooling (Graphify, Context7):** Implementation details evolve, so never rely
  on hardcoded file lists or memory of the code. Any agent that has these tools must use them:
  - **Graphify (architecture and relationships):** Before designing, auditing, or reviewing,
    query the knowledge graph (`graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path "A" "B"`,
    `graphify explain "<node>"`) for module boundaries, call paths, and blast radius. If
    `graphify-out/graph.json` is missing, build it (`/graphify .`); after code changes, refresh it
    with `/graphify . --update`.
  - **Symbol-level code work:** Use the LSP and search tools (find definition, find references,
    grep) instead of reading whole files, and check for missed callers before changing a symbol.
  - **Context7 (external APIs):** Before writing or reviewing code that depends on a library,
    framework, SDK, CLI, or service (database drivers, Alembic, pgvector, HTTP clients,
    transport SDKs, provider APIs, etc.), fetch current docs via
    `resolve-library-id` then `query-docs`. Do not code from recalled API knowledge.
  - **Agents without these tools** (for example, delegated workers) must rely on the paths, symbol
    names, and API facts provided in their task spec. If the spec lacks a needed fact, ask or
    escalate; never guess a library API or invent a file location.
- **Lockfile, Template, and Plugin Digest Synchronization:**
  - Whenever `pyproject.toml` dependencies or `[project.optional-dependencies]` change, always run
    `uv lock` so `uv.lock` remains in sync (`uv sync --locked` in `install.sh` and `Dockerfile`
    fails if `uv.lock` is stale).
  - Whenever configuration dataclasses (`monoagens/engine/config/`, `monoagens/engine/soul.py`,
    `monoagens/engine/access/roles.py`) or `monoagens/admin/templates.py` change, regenerate root
    `config.yaml`, `roles.yaml`, and `soul.yaml` from `templates.py`.
  - Whenever files inside `plugins/<name>/` change, update `digest:` in `plugins/<name>/plugin.yaml`
    via `.venv/bin/python -m monoagens plugins digest plugins/<name>`.
- **Verification Gate:** Keep the test suite and static checks clean after changes:
  - `uv lock --check`
  - `.venv/bin/ruff check monoagens scripts tests plugins migrations`
  - `.venv/bin/python -P scripts/selfcheck.py --check`
  - `.venv/bin/python -P scripts/types.py --check`
  - `.venv/bin/python -P scripts/adr.py --check`
  - `.venv/bin/pytest -q`
