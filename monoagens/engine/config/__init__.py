"""Load .env plus the combined config.yaml (host, engine, gateways, soul) and roles.yaml.

Validation is strict and never touches the filesystem beyond reading. ADR-0002 §4.1: the
operator files are authoritative; the DB documents are a derived cache the loader never reads.

The dataclasses, the engine schema, the section readers, and the two entry points live in
sibling modules; this module is the public surface the rest of the engine imports.
