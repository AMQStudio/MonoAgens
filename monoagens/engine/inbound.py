"""The embodiment-neutral seam: a body hands in a `Percept`, the engine emits `Action`s.

A body is a package under `monoagens/gateways/<name>/`; it talks to the engine only through the
types and protocols here (ADR-0004 §4.1-4.3). The outbound message is a Command Message: the
engine addresses an `Address`, the body routes the `Action` to its own handler by
`action.capability`, and answers with a `Receipt`.

* `GatewayCore` — mandatory: lifecycle, `dispatch`, display, and its own catalog.
* `Rich` — optional: files, media preparation, presence.
* `Directory` — optional: target resolution and thread membership.
* `PrivateThread` — optional: the one private thread a person holds.

`Percept` carries body facts, never transport rules. `hints` is an open mapping; the engine reads
`dm`, `mention`, `reply`, `group`, `presence` only where a decision needs them and never requires
a hint the body cannot supply. The known keys:

* `dm` — the thread is a direct conversation.
* `mention` — this turn was addressed by an explicit mention.
* `mentions` — the person ids the message mentions, other than the Soul (ADR-0012 §4.7); absent
  or empty when the body cannot parse ids.
* `reply` — this turn replies to one of the body's own messages.
* `group` — the thread has more than two participants.
* `presence` — the body observed activity without a message.
* `self` — the message came from the body's own account (never a turn).
* `app` — the application this message belongs to (ADR-0005); optional.
* `decision` — a `Decision` on one pending approval (kind `decision`, ADR-0013 §4.4).
