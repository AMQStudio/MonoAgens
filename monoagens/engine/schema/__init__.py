"""One MetaData for all soul state; Postgres types only (ADR-0002).

The table objects live in sibling modules by domain; this module is the public surface, so
`from .schema import <table>` keeps working exactly as it did when the definitions shared one
file. Every module mutates the same `metadata` instance.
